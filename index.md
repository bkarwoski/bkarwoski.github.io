# Experience
I've worked on software and hardware design at several robotics companies:

### [Carnegie Robotics](https://carnegierobotics.com/) (September - December 2020, Remote)
I had two projects as a software engineer intern.

### [Tusimple](https://www.tusimple.com/) (May - August 2020, Tucson, AZ)

### [Zipline](https://flyzipline.com/) (June - August 2019, Half Moon Bay, CA)

### [DJI](https://enterprise.dji.com/) (May - August 2018, Palo Alto, CA)

# Education

I'm a current M.S. student in the [University of Michigan's Robotics](https://robotics.umich.edu/) program, graduating May 2021.

I graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engeering, Magna Cum Laude, with Engineering Honors. I worked with the [Unmanned Systems Lab](https://unmanned.tamu.edu/) on building a drive-by-wire shuttle platform.

# Projects
[star_align:](https://github.com/bkarwoski/star_align) Align and combine multiple star photos, to create images such as this page's header. This is a re-write of a [tool I'd made in python](https://github.com/bkarwoski/StarStack), to get more familiar with CMake and working with libraries like [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

[Tree search controller:](https://github.com/bkarwoski/p4r) A three-part multithreaded project, written in pure C:
* A 2D physics simulator with collision resolution
* A tree search recursive path planner
* A graphics generator for display and debugging

[Deepfake Detection:](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14749.pdf) I implemented a frequency domain approach for detecting artificially created images, and trained it to classify fake videos from the Celeb-DF dataset.
